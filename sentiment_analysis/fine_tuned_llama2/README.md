# Sentiment Analyzer with Transformer Models

This project hosts the code for implementing a sentiment analysis tool using transformer models. It focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on a sentiment analysis task using the IMDB reviews dataset.

## Overview

The `SentimentAnalyzer` class in this repository allows for fine-tuning a sentiment analysis model. It includes capabilities for data loading, preprocessing, model setup, training, and evaluation.

### Features

- Fine-tuning the transformer-based model on sentiment analysis task.
- Implementation of 4-bit quantization for efficient memory usage.
- Use of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for model efficiency.
- Customizable training and evaluation setup.

## Installation

Before running the code, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- `numpy`
- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `evaluate`
- `peft`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy torch transformers datasets evaluate peft
```

## Usage

To use the sentiment analyzer, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the SentimentAnalyzer**:
   ```python
   from sentiment_analyzer import SentimentAnalyzer
   analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer(model_id="your-model-id", dataset_name="imdb")
   ```

2. **Run the Analyzer**:
   ```python
   analyzer.run()
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   ```python
   results = analyzer.evaluate()
   print(results)
   ```
