To create a `README.md` for the provided script, you'll want to include several key sections: an introduction, prerequisites, installation, usage, and any additional notes. Below is a template that you can use and customize for your specific script:

# Summarizer MLflow Model Deployment

## Introduction
This project involves the deployment of a text summarization model using MLflow. It leverages the MAQSoftware/Llama-2-32k-Summarization model from Hugging Face for summarization tasks. The script automates the downloading, saving, and loading of the model and tokenizer, and wraps the model using MLflow for easy deployment and usage.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
- MLflow
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Logging

You will also need a Hugging Face access token set as an environment variable (`HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`).

## Installation
To install the necessary libraries, run the following command:
```
pip install mlflow transformers torch torchvision torchaudio numpy
```

## Usage
To use the Summarizer model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set the `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` environment variable with your token.
3. Run the script. It will automatically download and save the model and tokenizer if they are not present locally.
4. Once the model is loaded, you can use the `predict` function to generate summaries. 

Example:
```python
book_content = "Your text here"
output = loaded_model.predict({'input_string': np.array([book_content])})
print(output)
```

## Additional Notes
- The script uses MLflow's PythonModel class to wrap the Hugging Face model, making it easier to deploy and scale.
- The BitsAndBytesConfig is used to optimize model performance.
- Ensure you handle exceptions and errors as shown in the script for robust operation.
